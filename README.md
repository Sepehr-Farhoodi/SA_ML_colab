This workflow is designed to simulate/predict streamflow by implementing different deep learning algorithms.
It consists of three main sections: 
1. Configuration section to define each model's hyperparameters.
2. Class definition section to create training tensors and ML method modules.
3. Main function section consists of different functions with clear explanations of what they do.
